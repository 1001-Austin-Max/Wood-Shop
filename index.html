          <h3>The Art of Wood Working</h3>
          <p>Wood working is the craft of using wood to create furniture, bowls, chairs, and much more.
          Being proficient at using wood in a design sense requires: patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to learn.
          Patience is very important in the wood shop because it allows the craftsman to not rush to a finished project, but to
          use all the resources and skills available to them to create the best product possible. This brings us to the next skill:
          attention to detail. Wood can be very tricky to manipulate and without a keen eye, a finished project's imperfections
          can pile up. Finally, a key aspect in mastery of the wood-shop is an ability to learn. No one is immune from mistakes and
          it's important to recognize mistakes in wood-working to learn and adapt in the next project</p>
          <h3>Starting a Wood Project</h3>

           <ol>
             <li>Create an initial drawing or sketch</li>
             <li>Plan out the dimensions of your project and what wood you'll use</li>
             <li>Make a final design</li>
             <li>Make a cut list</li>
             <li>Make a step by step plan of what you'll do until the end</li>
          </ol>
           Doing this ensures that you've thought through every part of your project so that you won't </p>
